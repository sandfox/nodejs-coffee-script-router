# Coffeescript Request Router

Just a simple POC for routing node.js requests based on pathname.

Written mostly for fun and as example

Very simplistic:
+ Only allows adding one callback per route at a time.
+ No paramter matching in the pathname.
+ Only supports a few HTTP methods (trivial to add more)
+ Support only 1 error handler and 1 not-found handler
+ Has no tests

If none of the above are problems then you are in luck!
